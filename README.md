# 🛒 E-commerce Customers Analysis & Revenue Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce customer data to understand purchasing behavior and predict **annual revenue** using **Machine Learning Regression models**.  
Understanding customer behavior is critical for optimizing marketing strategies, improving customer experience, and increasing sales.

---

## ✅ Problem Statement
E-commerce companies need to identify which customers are likely to spend more in order to **target marketing efforts effectively**.  
**Goal:** Predict **customer yearly spending** based on demographic and behavioral features.

## 🛠 Steps Taken:
### 1️⃣ **Data Exploration**
- Explored the dataset to understand structure and relationships.
- Checked for missing values and inconsistencies.

### 2️⃣ **Data Cleaning**
- Removed duplicates and handled null values.
- Normalized and standardized features for better model performance.

### 3️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized feature distributions (e.g., Age, Time on Website).
- Analyzed correlation between features and **Yearly Amount Spent**.

### 4️⃣ **Feature Selection**
- Selected key features influencing revenue:  
  - Average Session Length
  - Time on App
  - Time on Website
  - Length of Membership

### 5️⃣ **Model Building**
- Implemented:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Ridge & Lasso Regression**
- Evaluated models using:
  - **R² Score**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

### 6️⃣ **Visualization**
- Plotted **actual vs predicted values** to assess model accuracy.
- Displayed residuals distribution to check assumptions.

## 📈 Key Insights:
✔ **Length of Membership** has the highest impact on yearly spending.  
✔ Customers who spend more time on the **App** tend to spend more money.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies:
- **Python**
- **Libraries**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and model development.
